# 🧠 Vanshika AI Persona Project
The Vanshika AI Persona project is a comprehensive application that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to create a conversational AI persona. The project consists of multiple components, including a retrieval-augmented generator (RAG) pipeline, a FastAPI backend, and various services for handling tasks such as query embedding, semantic retrieval, and calendar integration. The primary goal of the project is to provide a conversational AI interface that can engage in meaningful discussions and respond to user queries in a contextually relevant manner.

## 🚀 Features
- **RAG Pipeline**: A retrieval-augmented generator pipeline that enables the AI persona to retrieve and generate contextually relevant responses to user queries.
- **FastAPI Backend**: A FastAPI application that provides a RESTful API for interacting with the AI persona and handling tasks such as chat, calendar, and VAPI functionality.
- **Query Embedding**: A service that utilizes Google Gemini for embedding queries and performing cosine-similarity search via Supabase.
- **Semantic Retrieval**: A service that retrieves relevant context chunks for a given query using RAG.
- **Calendar Integration**: A service that integrates with the Cal.com API v2 for fetching available time slots, booking time slots, and fetching booking details.
- **Chat Interface**: A streaming response for chat messages with RAG-augmented context.
- **Note:** **Outbound calling** is fully integrated through Vapi. During testing, the free Vapi phone number could successfully authenticate and initiate outbound call requests. However, Vapi's free phone numbers do not support international calling, so calls to Indian numbers require either a paid Vapi number or an imported Twilio number. **The integration is complete and can be verified using supported US phone numbers.**
